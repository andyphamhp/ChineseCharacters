# Sequential Thinking MCP Server Setup

## Overview
The Sequential Thinking MCP server enables structured, step-by-step problem-solving with the ability to revise and branch reasoning paths.

## Installation Status
âœ… **Successfully installed and activated for this project**

The Sequential Thinking MCP server has been configured using Claude Code's CLI:
```bash
claude mcp add sequential-thinking npx -- -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

## Installation

### For Claude Code CLI (Current Setup)
The server is already configured for this project. To verify:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

### For Claude Desktop

1. Create or edit the configuration file at:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the Sequential Thinking server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

### For VS Code with Continue Extension

1. Open VS Code settings
2. Search for "continue.mcpServers"
3. Add the Sequential Thinking configuration

## Usage in Chinese Characters Project

The Sequential Thinking tool is particularly useful for:

1. **Complex Feature Implementation**
   - Breaking down data persistence implementation
   - Planning the practice summary integration
   - Designing spaced repetition algorithms

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Evaluating SwiftData vs Core Data for persistence
   - Planning the migration from static to dynamic data
   - Designing the progress tracking system

3. **Problem Solving**
   - Debugging complex practice flow issues
   - Optimizing performance bottlenecks
   - Resolving UI/UX challenges

## Example Usage

When working on complex tasks, I can use sequential thinking to:

```
Thought 1: Analyze the current static data structure in Lesson.swift
Thought 2: Evaluate persistence options (SwiftData, Core Data, JSON)
Thought 3: Design migration strategy from static to persistent data
Thought 4: Plan implementation phases with minimal disruption
Thought 5: Consider rollback strategies if issues arise
```

## Benefits

- Structured approach to complex problems
- Ability to revise conclusions based on new information
- Clear documentation of reasoning process
- Improved decision-making for architectural choices
